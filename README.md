##Why make a Status Board?
Status board is an iPad app that allows the user to gather and display data that is important to them. The App is essentially a productivty tool. Users can disply information in various different forms, such as a table, graph, or calendar, and they can also make their own customized panel. Each panel can be updated as needed, and switched out when they are no longer needed. The App also provides a consistent look to each panel, so the the status board looks stylish and works as a whole, even with different panels of information. The status board can also be used on TVs with an HDMI cable.


##How?
Panic.com provides instructions on how to add info. to the status board, and provides different options so that users without knowledge of html can still use this app. The most basic panels: weather, time, calendar, are ready to be used and only need to be dragged onto the status board to be used. The user can put their own information on the App through two different ways. The first is by making a table in a program like excel and saving the file as an cvs file. The file then needs to be put onto a sharing site, such as Dropbox, or hosted on a webiste, so that the status board can access it. The user can place the file in dropbox in the public file folder, and then select the "public link" button to get a link that will be used on the status board to find the file. The link can also be shortened through a website like bit.ly to make it easier to copy and retype. This path will make a generic looking table of information that functions fine, but is uncustomizable in appearance. 
The other route, is to create an html file and create your own panel. If you know html, this is an easy process, the only hitch might come in hosting the file, but this can be done on a webiste like github that will host the file for free. It is also important to keep in mind that the status board panels scale at certain ratios that are preset. So the html file should be sized to match.
